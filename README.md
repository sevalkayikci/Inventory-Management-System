## 🧠 Inspiration

As a newly graduated software engineer 🎓, I built this project to solve a real-world problem I personally faced while running my own café ☕.

Managing inventory across different storage areas (like bar, kitchen, and stock) was becoming frustrating, especially without a centralized system. So I decided to design and develop my own solution — fast, mobile-friendly, and tailored to small business needs.

This system is meant for cafés, small shops, and individuals like me who want to stay organized without relying on bulky enterprise software.
